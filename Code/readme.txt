Project Description 
------------------- 
 
We propose an idea to control the home appliances with a remote without changing their internal circuitry. We achieve this by controlling the switch board that controls the appliances. We mount a box on the switch board and the box controls the switches. We arrange things such that a remote can be used to talk to the box.
